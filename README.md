## üê≥ How to Run using Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:grumpyp/aixplora.git
    ```

2. **Build Docker Image & Spin Up Containers**
    ```
    install=true docker compose up --build
    ```

3. **Initial Build**
    - Ensure the `frontend/node_modules` folder is absent on the first command execution.
    - The initial building process might be prolonged due to dependency installation.

4. **Post-Build Notification**
    - After the build and package installation concludes, an error might appear in the console: `app exited with code null, waiting for change to restart it`. This is a known issue we're addressing.

5. **Access the UI**
    - Visit `http://localhost:1212/`.

6. **Subsequent Launches**
    ```
    docker compose up
    ```
    üìù **Notes**:
    - After appending new packages in `requirements.txt`, execute `docker compose up --build`.
    - Post adding fresh packages in `package.json`, use `install=true docker compose up` for new package installations.
    - To solely launch the frontend: `docker compose up frontend`.
    - To solely launch the backend: `docker compose up backend`.
